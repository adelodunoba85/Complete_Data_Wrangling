# OneCampus Academy

The work undertaken at OneCampus serves as a comprehensive showcase of proficient data wrangling, adept data visualization, and the adept construction and fine-tuning of models

# TASK

The Muskets Football team is preparing for the next season and asked for the data to be clean and preprocess their data and hopefully help predict number of hits by each player through:

1. Conducting a full-range cleaning of the data
2. Preprocess the cleaned data and transform it into well-behaved data.
3. Select input features for an outcome feature of HITS

# Complete Data Wrangling

The endeavors conducted at OneCampus represent a thorough exhibition of the entire data science pipeline, encompassing meticulous data wrangling, insightful data visualization, and the intricate process of constructing, fine-tuning, and optimizing models. 

# Data Wrangling

The process of data wrangling involved the comprehensive preparation and cleansing of raw data. This step included tasks such as handling missing values, removing outliers, and structuring the data in a manner suitable for analysis. Data wrangling is foundational for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses.

# Data Visualization 

Effective data visualization played a pivotal role in presenting insights derived from the data. Through the creation of informative charts, graphs, and visual representations, complex patterns and trends within the data were made accessible and understandable to stakeholders. This step facilitates data-driven decision-making and enhances the communication of findings.

# Model Building and Optimization 

The core of the work revolved around the construction of predictive models. This process entailed selecting appropriate algorithms, training the models on the data, and fine-tuning their parameters to achieve optimal performance.
